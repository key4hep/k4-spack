#### Nightly build of key4hep-stack
# this job expects the following setup on the runner:
# * environment variables GITHUB_TOKEN and GITHUB_USER
#   set in .bashrc or via gitlab ci - to be able to query the commits on github
# *  (for the nightlies) existing installation of key4hep-stack (stable version) in /cvmfs/sw.hsf.org/spackages
#   (or whatever is defined in upstreams.yaml)
#   this may be read-only - could be delivered by cvmfs
# * writeable directory in /cvmfs/sw-nightlies.hsf.org 
#   (or whatever is defined in config.yaml)
#  
# for the cvmfs deployment:
# * the gitlab-runner user must be able to ssh into the cvmfs publisher
# * the cvmfs publisher must be able to rsync with the build machine
